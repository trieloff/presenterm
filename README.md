> [!NOTE]
> **This is a personal fork** with experimental ASCII art and banner features. See the [original presenterm repository](https://github.com/mfontanini/presenterm) for the official version.
>
> ### New Features in This Fork:
>
> - **ASCII Art Blocks**: Use ` ```ascii ` for plain ASCII art with optional animations
> - **FIGlet Banners**: Use ` ```banner:fontname ` to create text banners in 149+ different fonts
> - **17 Animation Styles**: rainbow, matrix, wave, plasma, fire, glitch, kaleidoscope, and more
> - **Animation Control**: `+animate:style`, `+loop`, `+once`, `+static` attributes
> - **Plain Defaults**: Banners render in monochrome by default—add color selectively with `+animate:rainbow`
>

_presenterm_ lets you create presentations in markdown format and run them from your terminal, with support for image 
and animated gifs, highly customizable themes, code highlighting, exporting presentations into PDF format, and plenty of 
other features. This is how the [demo presentation](/examples/demo.md) looks like when running in the [kitty 
terminal](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/):
