# Asciinema Recording Support

This presentation demonstrates embedding asciinema recordings in slides.

<!-- end_slide -->

## Live Terminal Recording

Here's an embedded asciinema recording:

```asciinema
examples/demo.cast
```

<!-- end_slide -->

## Using the cast alias

You can also use `cast` as the language identifier:

```cast
examples/demo.cast
```

<!-- end_slide -->

## End

That's it! Asciinema recordings are now supported in presenterm.
